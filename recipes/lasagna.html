    <h1>Lasagna</h1>

    <img src="Lasagna.webp" alt="Lasagna">
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that consists of layers of wide, flat pasta sheets alternated with rich, savory fillings. 
        The base is typically made of a tomato-based meat sauce, often featuring ground beef or pork, simmered with onions, garlic, 
        and herbs such as basil and oregano. A creamy béchamel or ricotta cheese mixture is spread between the layers, adding richness 
        and a smooth texture. These layers are stacked and then baked in the oven until golden and bubbling. The top layer is often covered 
        with mozzarella cheese, which melts into a gooey, cheesy crust. The dish is hearty, satisfying, and full of flavors from the savory 
        meat, creamy cheeses, and tangy tomato sauce. It is usually served hot and can be garnished with fresh basil or grated Parmesan cheese 
        for added flavor.

    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions (if using regular noodles), then drain and set aside. If using no-boil noodles, skip this step.</li>
        <li>In a large pan, heat olive oil over medium heat and sauté chopped onions and garlic until softened.</li>
        <li>Add the ground beef (or beef and pork mixture) to the pan and cook until browned. Drain any excess fat.</li>
        <li>Stir in the tomato sauce, crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Simmer for 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally. If desired, add red wine and sugar to balance the acidity.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, combine ricotta cheese, 1/2 of the shredded mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, egg, and chopped parsley (if using). Mix until smooth.</li>
        <li>If using béchamel sauce, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the flour and cook for 1-2 minutes. Slowly add the milk, whisking constantly until the sauce thickens. Season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg.</li>
        <li>Begin assembling the lasagna: Spread a thin layer of meat sauce at the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Place a layer of lasagna noodles over the sauce.</li>
        <li>Spread a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles.</li>
        <li>Add another layer of meat sauce over the ricotta mixture.</li>
        <li>Repeat the layers of noodles, ricotta cheese mixture, and meat sauce until all ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of meat sauce on top.</li>
        <li>Top the final layer with the remaining shredded mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake for 25-30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes until the cheese is golden and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna cool for about 10 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
